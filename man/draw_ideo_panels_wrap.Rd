\description{
This function handles the assembly of panels into a
\code{\link[gtable]{gtable}} object. This is a method of the "FacetIdeoWrap"
\code{\link[ggplot2]{ggproto}} class. This method recieves from objects
elsewhere in the plot a list of \code{\link[grid]{grid.grob}} with the
contents of panels. This method is responsible for decorating the panels with
axes, strips and ideograms and positioning these together in a gtable.
}
\details{
Since this is a method of a class, this function should only be used
  indirectly by users.
