}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}} or
\code{\link[ggplot2:aes_]{aes_()}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the
default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the
plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this
layer, as a string.}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}}. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
\code{colour = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}

\item{outside}{\code{logical} of length 1 that controls wether to move the
rectangles outside of the plot area. For the best results, it is probably
best to set \code{coord_cartesian(clip = "off")} and avoid overlap with the
default axes by changing the sides argument to \code{"tr"}.}

\item{sides}{A \code{string} of length 1 that controls which sides of the
plot the rug-rectangles appear on. A string containing any letters in
\code{"trbl"} will set it to top, right, bottom and left respectively.}

\item{length}{A \code{\link[grid]{unit}} object that sets the width and
height of the rectangles in the x- and y-directions respectively. Note that
scale expansion can affect the look of this.}

\item{linejoin}{Line join style (round, mitre, bevel).}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:borders]{borders()}}.}
}
\description{
Like rug plots display data points of a 2D plot as lines in the
  margins, this function plots rectangles in the margins. Rectangular rugs
  are convenient for displaying onedimensional, ranged annotations for
  twodimensional plots.
}
\details{
By default, scales are expanded 5\% on either side of the plot,
  whereas the rug rectangles will occupy 3\% of the total plot size by
  default. The \code{geom_rectmargin()} and \code{geom_tilemargin()} versions do the
  same thing, but are parameterised differently; see
  \code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_rect}}.

  These functions do not have hardcoded required aesthetics, since the x and
  y directions can be omitted by not choosing a side in the corresponding
  direction, i.e. y-direction variables are omitted when plotting the rug only
  on the top and/or bottom. This can result in errors when the aesthetics are
  not specified appropriately, so some caution is advised.

\section{Aesthetics}{

\code{geom_rectmargin()} requires either one of the following
sets of aesthetics, but also can use both:

\itemize{
 \item \strong{xmin}
 \item \strong{xmax}
}

and/or:

\itemize{
 \item \strong{ymin}
 \item \strong{ymax}
}

\code{geom_tilemargin()} requires either one of the following
sets of aesthetics, but can also use both:

\itemize{
 \item \strong{x}
 \item \strong{width}
}

and/or:

\itemize{
 \item \strong{y}
 \item \strong{height}
}

Furthermore, \code{geom_rectmargin()} and \code{geom_tilemargin()} also
understand these shared aesthetics:

\itemize{
 \item alpha
 \item colour
 \item fill
 \item group
 \item linetype
 \item size
}
}

\examples{
# geom_rectmargin() is parameterised by the four corners
df <- data.frame(
  xmin = c(1, 5),
  xmax = c(2, 7),
  ymin = c(1, 2),
  ymax = c(2, 4),
  fill = c("A", "B")
)


ggplot(df, aes(xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax,
               ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax,
               fill = fill)) +
  geom_rect() +
  geom_rectmargin()

# geom_tilemargin() is parameterised by center and size
df <- data.frame(
  x = c(1, 4),
  y = c(1, 2),
  width = c(2, 1),
  height = c(1, 2),
  fill = c("A", "B")
)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y,
               width = width, height = height,
               fill = fill)) +
  geom_tile() +
  geom_tilemargin()
}
